# Preparing for Influenza Season
## Objective
### Analyze data for the staffing needs across the US for a medical staffing agency during Influenza season
## Requirements

   ### Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform medical personnel's timing and spatial distribution throughout the United States.
   ### Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, does it start and end simultaneously (month) in every state?
   ### Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
   ### Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.
   
## Assumptions
   ### Older people are most at risk of being severely affected by the flu. Find the States where the population of these people is the largest
## Data I have been working on

### Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender from US-CDC Population data by geography and age, US Census Bureau Counts of influenza laboratory test results by state (survey) from US-CDC Counts of visits of patients with influenza in hospital from US-CDC Survey of flu shot rates in children from US-CDC
